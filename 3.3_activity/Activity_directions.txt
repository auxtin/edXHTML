Activity - Units
Row of books

With the HTML below, please size the text using different units:

-Use px units to set the root size of the text for the document.
-Use rem units to size the h1 and li tags.
-Change the text size of the root CSS rule. 
You should observe all the text of the document adjusting appropriately. 
-Change the h1 so that it uses px units. 
As the root CSS rule is changed, the h1 will no longer adjust with the rest of the document.
